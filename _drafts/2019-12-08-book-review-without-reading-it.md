I've just got this book in the mail and spent around 4 minutes skimming through it. And then I stumbled upon page nr. 182 - and it blew my mind. 



It just may have thought me the biggest lesson any other book ever did. I like books, I read a lot of them and I buy a lot of them. Oftentimes I would buy a book and it will sit on my shelf waiting for its time to come. And then the time comes - I need something, remember the book and here it is - just the right timing. I am very excited and finish it quickly - it seems like it had so many valuable insights, lessons and ideas for me.

But then the time goes by
