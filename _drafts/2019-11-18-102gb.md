One of the first things I introduced in my new team is 10 minute agenda point in the weekly team meeting - 10.2GB - 10 minutes to get better.

The idea is to take a few minutes and to share knowledge with each other. It can be work related, technical, non-technical - anything.


* Python context manager
* SQL in Google Sheets
* Semantic Versioning
* Mindfulness
* Indexing in MySQL
* Usage `async` in JavaScript
* AARRR startup metrics
